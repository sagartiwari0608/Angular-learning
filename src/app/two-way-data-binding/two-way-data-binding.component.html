<!--  Now TWO WAY DATA BINDING  -->
<!-- we have seen in above examples that we had to use property binding as well as event binding
now when we use both together in Angular its called two way data binding.  and syntax is [()]-->

<input title="anyname" type="text" [(ngModel)]="inputValue" >
<!--  this also works so all the work is being handled by angular itself. -->
<h1>{{inputValue}}</h1>
